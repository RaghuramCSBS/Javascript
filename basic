js is single threaded and synchronous language
js have a execution context with consist of 2 components:
1)memory 2)code
js run code in 2 phase:
1)memory creation 2)thread of execution

In memory creation phase variable are assigned with a keyword undifined and function as stored as funtions in key:value style
in thread of execution js assign value to variable which holding undine and execute logic in case of function its creates another execution context


Hoisting:
it is a feature in js where we can access variables and function even before inisialition
order of execution is maintained by a stack called call stack

Window object:
in js window object is created along with global execution context what ever we define in global space they will be attached to window object

global space:
anything outside any function is global space
